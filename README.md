# FreeScore
Basically this program just lets you download the first page of any score on the MuseScore website without having to pay for anything. *please don't sue me musescore*

## Installing & Running

1) Download this repository.
2) Unzip the files.
3) Run `install_lib.bat` on Windows, or `install_lib.sh` on MacOS or Linux to install the required libraries for this program.
4) If you're planning to run the program in the command-line, use this format: `python3 main.py [Score Link]`. If you're going to run the program in the Python shell, the program will instead prompt you for the link.
5) Once the program returns an image URL, just paste that into your browser and save the image at the URL to your computer.
